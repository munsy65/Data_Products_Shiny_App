This app uses the MTCars data set which tracks MPG for many models of cars.
The data sets includes many different configuration options.  The app uses
four of them to show how they can affect your MPG.

You can use the drop down menu to pick an option.
  
  
Your choices are:
* Number of Cylinders
* Number of Gears
* Transmission type (Auto, Manual)
* Number of Carbs
  
  
Once you pick your option from the drop down *click View Plot*.

You will see a box plot of the MPG range for your choice.
